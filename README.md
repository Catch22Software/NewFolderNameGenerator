# Folder Name Generator

## Author: James M.

## Date: April 2022

### Directions:
- Run .jar file.
- Type numerical year that you would like to start with.
- If you leave it blank, it defaults to the current year.
- Type numerical month that you would like to start with.
- If you leave it blank, it defaults to the current month.
- Program will then allow you to confirm the chosen month and year.
- Selecting no will loop back to the beginning.
- Selecting cancel will close the program.
- Selecting yes will continue.
- Program will then take the inputted month and year and will create folders with the dates as long as they don't exist.

### Example:
1) Current month and year is April 2022.
2) "2022" is entered in the year input box.
3) "03" is entered in the month input box.
4) Program will create a folder for every day in March for the current year.
5) Program will create a folder for every day in April including the current day.
6) Program will not make duplicate folders and only looks at folder names.

### Important:

- Place .jar file in the folder you want the creation to take place in.
- If you get an error, most likely the security settings for folder creation need to be checked.
- Date is taken from System date and time.
- Only works for years >= 1900. ( try it, you'll make a TON of folders :) )
- If you have the extra time, its over 35k folders.
- Date folder format created uses "MM-dd-YY" format.
- Can be changed within the source code to utilize different formats.
