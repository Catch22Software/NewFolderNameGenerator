# Folder Name Generator

## Author: James M.

## Date: April 2022

### Directions:
- Run .jar file.
- Type numerical month that you would like to start with the name generation.
- If you leave it blank, it defaults to the current month.
- If you cancel the prompt in any way, it defaults to the current month.
- Program will then take the inputted month and will create folders with the dates as long as they don't exist.

### Example:
1) Current month is April.
2) "03" is entered in the input box.
3) Program will create a folder for every day in March for the current year.
4) Program will create a folder for every day in April up to the current day.
5) Program will not make duplicate folders and only looks at folder names.

### Important:

- Place .jar file in the folder you want the creation to take place in.
- If you get an error, most likely the security settings for folder creation need to be checked.
- Date is taken from System date and time.
- Only works for current year.
- Date folder format created uses "MM-dd-YY" format.
- Can be changed within the source code to utilize different formats.
